/**The GradedExercise class contains methods for linear search, binary search, selection sort, insertion sort, splitting a list, and a main method containing tests of the other methods.

 * 
 * The linear search method was one of the easiest ones to make. It was straightforward and short, just a method to look at each integer in an 
 * ArrayList and see if it matches with the integer being searched for.
 * 
 * Making a binary search was much harder, and I originally had it performing too many actions to be efficient. I realized this and rewrote it to 
 * sort the given ArrayList and create narrower and narrower ranges until it found the desired integer, or the place where it would exist if 
 * present.
 * 
 * The selection sort method begins by creating a couple of variables and has a while-loop that will not break until the ArrayList newList has 
 * as many integers in it as the original given ArrayList to ensure that all the elements of the original list were moved over. The min variable 
 * starts with a value whatever the first element in the ArrayList is, but is changed to the next number if it is found to be smaller. After one 
 * iteration of the while-loop, the smallest integer has been found, added to a new list, and removed from the original list. The new list will 
 * continue to have the smallest number of the ArrayList added to the end of it, keeping it sorted. The while-loop repeats comparing the new 
 * minimum (first element of the ArrayList, second element of the original ArrayList) with the next element and replacing it as smaller numbers 
 * are found once the new list contains as many elements as the original list did, the while-loop breaks and the method returns the new sorted 
 * list.
 * 
 * The insertion sort method starts with the first two elements of the ArrayList and swaps them if they are not in ascending order. If they are 
 * in order, the method moves on to the next two elements. Each time the elements are swapped and it's not the first iteration through the
 * for-loop, the indexes of the two elements being checked move back one place. If they are in order, the loop continues by moving the indexes
 * forward by one. The for loop breaks just before the code tries to reach an index that does not exist in the ArrayList. This means that the 
 * indexes of the two numbers being checked has reached the end of the list, so everything before it has to have been sorted. The method then 
 * returns the sorted list.
 * 
 * splitList is a method that we were not assigned to make, but I made and used it previously for one of the assigned methods, and thought it 
 * might end up being useful. It splits an ArrayList down the middle into two ArrayLists, and returns them as one ArrayList containing both 
 * ArrayLists. It's a bit confusing to explain, but when the return value is printed, it is easier to understand. I think I originally used this
 * method when making my first version of binarySort, but realized that the efficiency that binary sort is meant to have was being negated by the
 * extra steps taken to keep track of the splits with smaller and smaller ArrayLists. It almost worked, but I had no easy way to return the index
 * of the number, I could only return the number itself.
